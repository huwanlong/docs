Global warming is getting more and more serious. Every year, the temperature is rising, and the climate is changing. Many animals and plants are dying because of climate change. Fish in the sea are also dying because of warmer sea temperatures.

Who should be responsible for global warming? There is no doubt that we human beings are to blame. Our population keeps growing, and cars and factories keep growing, and cars and factories keep increasing in large numbers. They release a lot of heat into the atmosphere, causing global warming.

I chat over dinner with my parents. After dinner, I help Mom do the dishes. I enjoy listening to music instead of watching TV. I go to bed no later than 10 PM.

### 78. Don't Buy Medicine Yourself 别自己买药

Many people tend to go to the drugstore to buy medicine. Be careful. If you do so, you may ruin your health.

Doctor: How long has this been?

Mr.Johnson: Oh, that reminds me. I did get hit by the corner of my desk.

Doctor: Take off your shirt. Now, see? There is a bruise on your chest. That explains everything. You are fine.

Mr.Johnson: What a relief. Thank you, doctor.

### 80. Why Should We Have Friends? 为什么我们需要有朋友？

We are social beings. This means we cannot live alone. We need friends to help us through hard times. When we feel sad, our friends will comfort and encourage us. When we run into troubles, they will lend us a helping hand. However, we must be careful when we choose friends. Good friends put us on the right track, while bad ones may lead us into wrongdoing. It is not too much to say that a happy life is determined by the friends we make.

### 161. Sri Lanka 斯里兰卡

The famed Italian explorer Marco Polo considered Sri Lanka the finest island of its size in the world. Sri Lanka is slightly larger than the U.S. state of West Virginia. Through the years, this exotic island has had many names: Serendib, Ceylon, the Teardrop of India, and the Pearl of the Indian Ocean, just to name a few. Many visitors through the years have admired its richness and beauth. From 1798 until it gained independence from England in 1948, Sri Lankan culture was greatly influenced by the British. Thus, tea is an important part of Sri Lankan life. Ceylon tea from Sri Lanka is acclaimed as one of the best tea in the world, and tea is in production all year round. Sri Lanka is an island with many positive things to offer the curious traveler.

### 162. A Polite Man 有礼貌的人

When making a request, he says, "Please," and then, "Thank you," when he receives something. He stands up when a lady stands up, and he doesn't sit down until she is seated. He does not interrupt other people when they are talking, and he listens to what they have to say. He does not talk or laugh loudly in public. When eating, he doesn't speak with his mouth full of food. He always says, "Bless you," when someone else sneezes. And he uses a handkerchief when he sneezes or coughs. He is the prefect example of a polite person.

### 163. Practice Makes Perfect 熟能生巧

"Practice makes perfect" has often been said of learning a new skill. This is equally true of learning mathematics. Take Maggie for example. She would read the explanations and the sample problems in her book, and think she understood them so well that she didn't have to work out the problems. She never regarded mathematics as hard until examination times came. Then she found that she lacked the experience in applying what she had learned from reading to the solving of problems. Mathematics is practiced best throught the actual experience of solving problems, not just through reading about how to solve them. In math, just like a foreign language, practice makes perfect.

### 164. Books 读书的乐趣

Books are to mankind what memory is to the individual. They contain the history of our race, the discoveries we have made, and the accumulated knowledge and experience of many different time periods. They picture for us the wonder and beauty of nature and explain to us its many changes. Books teach us how to face and overcome difficult challenges, and comfort us when we are grieving. Books can change hours of boredom into moments of joy. They fill our minds with ideas and even a few happy thoughts. Like a good memory, a good book is a priceless treasure. If you find yourself bored by a book that educated people regard as important, be honest with yourself. The difficulty is probably not in the book but in you. Often a book, which now seems boring or difficult, will be easy to grasp and fascinating to read when you are more intellectually mature.

### 165. Failure 失败

Failure is never pleasurable. It hurts adults and children alike. On the other hand, it can make a positive contribution to your life once you learn how to take advantage of it. Step one is to ask, "Why did I fail?" Step two is to resist the natural impulse to blame someone else. Don't beat yourself up over your failure, either. Ask yourself what you did wrong and how you can improve. If someone else can help, don't be shy about asking. Maybe he or she has been through the same thing before. Many people enjoy helping others overcome a problem with which they have already struggled. This can save you a lot of time in learning how not to repeat the same mistakes in the future.

### 166. Is Music a Noise? 音乐是噪音吗？

A music lover of the nineteenth century might have had to make a considerable sacrifice of time and money to follow his hobby. However, the arrival of the radio has made an almost unbelievable difference in our lives. Nowadays, people do not have to pay money to follow their hobby of listening to music. Instead, they have to pay to get away from all the noise. Music has become part of the noise system that surrounds us. It is constantly in the air. It assails us at home and at school, in a taxi, and even along the sidewalk. There are even companies that make a living recommending the right kind of background music to anyone who may ask-be he the manager of a store selling expensive gowns, or a dentist with a waiting room full of nervous patients.

### 167. Enlarging Our Vocabulary 增加我们的词汇量

No one knows how man learned to make words. Perhaps he began by imitating animals. Perhaps he imitated sounds he heard all around him: the crashing of ocean waves, bees buzzing, or a stone falling to the ground. In some way he learned to make words. As the centuries went by, he made more words. This is waht we mean by language. The words we know are our vocabular. We should try to expand our vocabulary whenever possible. We should read as many books as we can, too. Of course, we will most likely come across words we didn't know before. When we find a new word, we should look it up in the dictionary. The dictionary is the most useful book of all.

### 168. Stay Fit for a Test 考前应注意健康

MInd and body work together. That is why it is important for you to take care of your body as well as your mind when you are preparing for an exam. Follow the common-sense rules of health: get sufficient sleep and rest, eat proper foods, and plan recreation and exercise. In relation to health and exams, two cautions are in order. First, don't skip meals prior to a test in order to keep studying. Secondly, don't miss your regular sleep by sitting up late "cramming" for the test. Cramming is an attempt to learn in a short period of time what should have been learned through consistent study. These two habits are harmful to one's health and rarely pay off in the long run. It is likely that you will be more confused than better prepared on the fay of the test if you have missed meals or lost sleep.

### 169. A High-Tech World 世界科技日日新

We are all aware that technology has created a world that even our ancestors would not have believed possible. Many of them would have been scared if they had know how society would become. We take most of this new world completely for granted. We merely push buttons, dial telephones and board jet planes without asking questions. We do not have a real sense of the fact that we know almost nothing about how these gadgets and machines work. Read popular magazines or watch commercials on TV, and you will see that faster transportation and more completely automatic conveniences are in the works. Many strange-looking machines will create an even happier world of tomorrow. Our children will live in a world more technologically advanced than the world which even we think is possible.

### 170. Ecology 生态学

In the last 150 years or so, scientists have become interested in the way animals and plants live together. This interest has created a new branch of science called ecology. Over millions of years, plants and animals have learned to change themselves so they can fit perfectly into their environment. For example, a saltwater fish lives best in the ocean and a mouse is healthiest in a field. Certain organisms may be found in a large area, but they do not live in all of it. They are usually only found in a small part of it. This is the place where it is easiest for them to live. Ecologists call this place their habitat. They study the way organisms survive in their natural habitat.

### 171. We Need Society 我们不能离开社会

In our efforts to improve society, we must keep in mind that everything in life is not always predictable. For example, things such as raising a family, coping with illness, making a decent living and preparing for old age are commong things in life that we all must face. These things do not always happen the way we plan.

Society is nothing more than a community. When we discuess the kind of society in which we want to live, we must remember its purpose. The reason why we must have society is to help people have the best possible life. In short, society should help people live their lives. If society helps us overcome the unpredictable obstacles we all face in life, it will make life even more worth living.

### 172. Louis Braille 盲人点字法发明人

Louis Braille was born in France in 1809. His father had a small business making leather goods. One day, Louis went into his father's workshop to cut some leather. Suddenly the knife slipped and hit him in the eye. An infection soon spread to his other eye, and Louis went completely blind.

At ten, Louis entered a school for the blind. One day his class went to visit a special exhibit. Here, Louis learned about a special militay code, which was make up of raised letters written on very thich paper.

Louis decided to write i the same way so blind people could "read" with their fingers. However, it was very difficult to feel the differences between letters. Instead, Braille developed his own system using a series of six dots. Today, Louis Braille's system is used around the world.

### 173. Inflation 通货膨胀

Inflation is an economic situation in which prices increase at the same time that the value of a nation's currency decreases. During times of inflation, people buy less because they cannot afford the inflated, or higher, prices. Since people buy less, production slows down, and many companies have to lay off workers. As this happens, more and more people start to worry about the future. Because of an increase in the number of unemployed workers, many people cannot afford to buy things they want. This period of high unemployment and low spending is called a recession. When two or more quarters have a decline in GDP, then a country is going through a recession. A quarter is one-fourth of the year. Thus, if you notice that less money is being made from the products your country produces during half the year, you can be certain it is going through a recession.

### 174. Moods and Weather 心情随天气而变化

When stormy weather appears. Psychologists say that rain or snow can bring on depression in many people. A friend of mine lived in Alaska for three years, and she stayed depressed for about six months of the year. The reason for her depression was due to the fact that the sun barely makes an appearance during half of the year in that part of the world. In contrast, during sunny weather, people in Alaska and elsewhere tend to be happier and friendlier. During pleasant weather, people are more willing to help each other. But when the summer weather becomes too hot and humid, people are likely to become more irritable.

### 175. Body Language 肢体语言

In additon to speaking with our voices, we alse talk with our bodies. People often move their hands to emphasize what they are saying and to show the person listening to them that they are saying something important. They also make facial gestures, such as raising their eyebrows or tilting their heads at an angle. Listeners use gestures, too. They may nod their heads to show that they have understood or shake them to indicate disagreement. While the power of speech gives us the ability to make a point, and the tone of our voice indicates our mood, it is our body language that is often more meaningful than our words.

### 176. Working Mothers 在职妈妈

The majority of women with children in industrialized nations work outside the home. Society has been slow to accept this fact, and it has done little to make life easier for working mothers. Not only do they have to work hard in the workplace, but back home, they have a lot of chores to do. It's not too much to say that working mothers live a tough life every day. Finding good, reliable childcare is often difficult. There are not enough daycare centers, and many working mothers do not have family members who are available to help them take care of their children.

Fathers do more to help rear their children than they did in the past. But they, too, have to work. Working mothers are not astisfied with the child-care arrangements available to them. Thus, What to do and which daycare center to depend on are critical questiosn working mothers struggle with each day.

### 177. Independence Day 美国国庆节

Americans celebrate their National Day every year on July 4th. It was on this day in 1776 that the colonists declared their independence from England. They did this on a piece of paper known as the Declaration of Independence. Thomas Jefferson is credited with writing most of it. He later became America's third president.

Nowadays, most Americans have a day off work and get together with family and friends for a barbecue or a picnic. Most friends for a barbecue or a picnic. Most children set off fireworks in the evening with their parents. The occasion is also marked by lavish fireworks displays in some communities. Of course, the flag is flown across America on the Fourth of July as a token of patriotism.

### 178. Bones and Smoking 骨折与抽烟

"Smoking is bad not only for your lungs, but for your bones as well, " says the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. Smoking increases your risk of developing osteoporosis, a disease that especially affects older women. The bones in people with this disease are weak and full of holes. Smoking causes osteoporosis, or fragile bones, by reducting the blood supply to your bones and slowing the production of bone-forming cells. Fragile bones increase your risk of a hip fracture as you age.

Fractures take longer to heal in smokers. Smokers also have a higher rate of complications after surgery than nonsmokers. Thus, if you are a smoker, it is in your best interest to stop. Not only will your lungs thank you, but your bones will be pleased as well.

### 179. We're Chameleons 我们与变色龙没什么两样

Most of us have learned to vary our language and our behavior to meet the needs of different circustances. We fell free to yell at our children when they have misbehaved, but we are not likely to shout at our bosses when they have upset us. We tease our friends, but we don't often joke around with strangers. Likewise, we may accept hugs and kissed from members of our family, but many of us get uneasy when people we don't know very well touch us. If you think about it, there are thousands of ways that we show that someone is a friend or someone we've just met.

### 180. Credit Cards 信用卡

When you pay for something with your credit card, the salesman will take your card and fill out a form using a computer or a machine. He will ask you to sign the form and then give you a copy. The credit card company sends you a bill once a month, showing the purchases you made and any balance left to pay from the month before. Usually, you have thirty days to pay before they charge you interest for new purchases. With a credit card, you find it easy and convenient to buy things.

For many people, however, a credit card can be a dangerous thing. This is because they spend more money than they could repay in thirty days' time. If so, they may end up in debt. For safety's sake, some have decided not to use credit cards any more.

### 181. Which Way to Go? 大城市浏览须知

One of a tourist's greatest problems in a new city is often finding her way to the things she needs and wants, such as food, a place to stay, and fun things to do. Most cities have a complicated transportation system, and a visitor will do well to master this system.

The first thing she should do is buy a  public transportation map of the city as soon as she arrives. Next, she should become familiar with the local routes and timetables. Armed with this knowledge, a tourist should be able to find her way around any part of the city. After all, it can be quite fun to travel through a new city, exploring intersting spots on the map.

### 182. Success 成功

There are no secrets to success. Success is doing the things you should do. It is not doing the things you know you should not do. It is not limited to any one area of your life. It is a part of every one of your relationships. You should try to be a success as a parent, a wife or husband, a neighbor, and a worker. You cannot become a success one day and stop there. You will always need to do things so that you can stay successful. Success is having the courage to fail and still keep going. It is refusing to let a loss stop you from reaching your lifelong goals. Anyone can be a success if he puts his mind to it.

### 183. The Earth 地球

When you stand on the beach and look at the sea, the horizon, or skyline, seems to stretch straight across from left to right for hundreds of kilometers. However, the horizon isn't a straight line. As you look at the far left and right edges of this line, you will notice what seem to be slight curvatures. The reason for these curves is that our earth is shaped like a sphere, or ball.

Seen from space, the earth is almost perfectly round and appears to have a smooth surface. The earth is one of many planets in our solar system. However, it is the only planet that has the right conditions for human life. Other planets would be too cold or too hot for humans, or the atmosphere would be too poisonous. The next time you go to the beach, remember that there is no other place like this planet anywhere else in the universe.

### 184. Just Do Our Best 凡事尽力而为

The people who seem to get the most out of life are those who have one thing in common: They go all out, no matter what they are doing. It does not matter if it is work or play. In everything, they try to do the best they can. They are satisfied with nothing but the best. These are the people who excel in sports, business, art and politics, to name a few. A friend of mine is just this type of person. He is always winning awards for being the top salesman in his company. By nature, most people do not always try to be the best at everything they do, but it would not hurt society if everyone tried to follow my friend's example.

### 185. Dreams Mirror Life 梦反映现实生活

For thousands of years, people have tried to figure out these kinds of dreams mean. Scientists and scholars alike think they may have begun to understand. They think that these dreams mirror our real lives. If we understand our dreams, we might be able to improve our lives.

For example, being chased and yet unable to move often means that something in our lives seems hopeless. Nightmares that include falling mean we are insecure about something important. When we dream of ourselves in helpless situations night after night, we can use this information to improve some of the things in our real lives. After all, no one wants every dream to come true.

A mad actor killed him while he was at the theater, days before the war came to an end.

### 187. Anasazi Pueblos 阿那萨齐部落的石屋城

By the 9th century, several Indian tribes had prospered in North America. One of these was the Anasazi. The Anasazi Indians lived in pueblos. Pueblos are large, multistory apartment compounds made of stone. Its name comes from the Spanish word for "town". A pueblo usually contains dozens of houses constructed below cliffs. It was large enough to hold up to hundreds of families.

Aside from living quarters, each pueblo included one or more circular underground rooms. They provided a suitable place where the elders led religious ceremonies and the villagers settled their affairs. When the Spanish first arrived in the area, they heard stories of cities made of gold, but none of these cities was ever found. Anasazi pueblos were probably the source of this myth.

Ancient Greeks were romantic, loved freedom, and valued physical fitness and strength in their education of the youth. Their love of sports was in harmony with their religion. To honor their chief god, Zeus, they held games once every four years at the foot of Mt. Olympus. The games were mode up of contests of sports, music, and literature. Only men participated in the original games, and they did so in the nude. Athletes that had been selected and sent by cities competed for prizes. Winners were awarded a crown made of wild olive leaves. When the olive crown was presented to the winner, there were people singing poems to express their respect. Greeks loved the games so much that they would stop any war in progress to let the athletes come and return home safely after the games.

### 189. Holes on the Moon 月球上坑洞的由来

There are many holes, or craters, on the moon. A few decades age, it was believed that the holes were caused by volcanic eruptions. Today, scientists believe that objects from outer space created them. The process is actually quite simple. When a meteorite strikes the ground, a huge amount of heat is produced. This heat melts the meteorite and the nearby soil. A part of  the meteorite and the soil evaporates and leaves a large hole behind. Normally, the larger the meteorite is, the larger the hole it creates. Scientists estimate that the meteorite that produced the largest lunar crater weighed more than 200 billion tons. Lunar scientists are learning all the time, and soon they will have solved all the mysteries of the moon.

### 190. The Sun 太阳

The sun is the star that is the central body of our solar system. Around this star, Earth and other planets revolve, and from it they receive light and heat. The sun is part of the Milky Way and is only one of billions of stars in the universe. Despite being an ordinary star, our sun is more important to man than any other star. If there were no heat or light from the sun, there could be no life on Earth.

On average, the distance from the sun to Earth is 93 million miles, yet the sun comes closer to Earth than any other star. Therefore, scientists study it to learn about stars much farther away. The surface of the sun consists of hot gases that give off light and heat. Only a very small portion of the star's energy reaches Earth, and the rest is lost in space.

### 191. An Expedition 一次探险

Before the discovery of the American continents by Europeans in the fifteenth century, there was an interestion expedition. Late in the tenth century, Eric the Red, a Norwegian, discovered Greenland and planned a colony there. Shortly afterward, a Norwegian ship bound for Greenland lost its way and landed on a coast after nine days' sail to the south. In the year 1000, Leif the Lucky, a son of Eric, explored this region. He named it Vinland. It is assumed that what he found was the coast of Newfoundland. The Norwegian sailors tried a few years later to start a colony there, but the project was abandoned because of the unfriendliness of the natives. Even though these efforts failed, it is amazing that the landings were at such an early date.

### 192. Wood 木材

The resources of the American did not differ strikingly from those of Europe, except in one way. Especially by comparision with the British, Americans had a plentiful supply of wood. Wood was the foundation of economy. First of all, houses and buildings were made of wood to an extent that was unknown in Britain. Secondly, wood was used as a fuel for heating and cooking. It was used for other things, too, but these are the two most important. Whereas Englishmen could be arrested for chopping down a tree on the king's land, Americans could find available wood everywhere they looked. Even today, America has an abundance of wood.

### 193. Pablo Picasso 毕加索

It sometimes happens that an artist will acquire traditioal skills and then, wishing to break away from the past, he will discard them. Pablo Picasso is a good example of an artist who did just that. Early in his career, he mastered the techniques of drawing and painting. Then he learned to do without the old ways and moved towards something entirely his own.

A top European artist, Picasso drew and sculpted. However, he is most famous for his unusual paintings. The Spaniard is said to have been brilliant and generous. At the same time, he was also chauvinistic and ruthless. Even so, that didn't lessen his reputation as a great artist. In fact, his artistic explorations helped shape the course of 20th-century modern art. The art world has not been the same since Picasso came on the scene.

### 194. Thank You, Doggie! 谢谢你，狗狗！

Dog-training centers the world over train dog guides for the blind, deaf, and other physically challenged people. German shepherds, Labradors, and golden retrievers are used as guides for the blind. These particular breeds have proven successful because of their willingness, health, and mild temperament.

Service dogs for the deaf are usually mixed breeds rescued from animal shelters. Friendly, energetic, and intelligent dogs are chosen to alert their masters to sounds in their home or work environment.

Training a guide dog is a multi-step process. "Seeing" dogs are taught to be on duty when in harness. When out of harness, they behave like any other dog and are treated as family pets. "Hearing" dogs have a less rigid set of rules. Masters of these dogs may have a physical challenge, but all their dogs see is love.

### 195. A Great Cartoonist 创造史努比的漫画家

At the time of his death in 2000, Charles M.Schulz's work appeared in over 2300 newspapers. He had published more than 1400 books and his talent had earned him many awards throughout his 50-year career. What was it that Schulz did to earn him so much recognition around the world? He created the beloved comic strip, "Peanuts".

Who can forget such characers as Charlie Brown and Snoopy? It was one of the first comic strips with more than two or three characters. Each "Peanuts" character brought special humor and insight to life. His comic strip dealt with psychology, social commentary, and humor. What made it special was that all these issues were dealt with from a child's viewpoint. "There is a market for innocence." said Schulz.

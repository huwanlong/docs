Global warming is getting more and more serious. Every year, the temperature is rising, and the climate is changing. Many animals and plants are dying because of climate change. Fish in the sea are also dying because of warmer sea temperatures.

Our population keeps growing, and cars and factories keep growing, and cars and factories keep increasing in large numbers. They release a lot of heat into the atmosphere, causing global warming.

I'm an early bird; in other words, I get up early every morning. I'm usually busy in the morning. Soon after I get up, I brush my teeth and clean my face. Then, I go jogging for half an hour before taking a shower. I grab a bite to eat and then rush to the nearby bus stop. It takes me half an hour to get to work. I work from 8 AM to 12 PM at noontime. I have lunch at an eatery near my office. At 1 PM I'm back to work till 5 PM. Sometimes I have to work overtime, but that happens only once or twice a year. When I get back home, it's usually 6 PM. I chat over dinner with my parents. After dinner, I help Mom do the dishes. I enjoy listening to music instead of watching TV. I go to bed no later than 10 PM.

### 72. World war II 第二次世界大战

All of us know that World War II took place in Europe on September 1, 1939. The horrible war lasted for 6 years. It ended on September 2, 1945. During the entire war, 50 million to 85 million people lost their lives, including countless small children. Many buildings collapsed because of bombing.

### 74. Stay Fit by Working Out 通过锻炼保持健康

Some people love working out. They go to the gym as often as possible. However, exercising every day is not the best thing for your health. Getting the most benefit from a workout depends on how often you rest. If you exercise once a week, you won't get mush benefit, but it is always better than nothing. Going to the gym twice a week will help to keeep you fit. Three times a week will help you to stay healthy. Four of five times a week will improve your health, and you will lose weight. If you never to to the gym, you can still keep fit. Activities such as table tennis and badminton are great ways to exercise with a friend.

### 75. Man's Best Friend 人类最好的朋友

In most countries, dogs are the most popular pets. Many people prefer dogs to other animals because they are just like family members. Having a dog is also like having a friend.

However, training the dog is also very important. The dog must know that it cannot bite one of the children if it is accidentally hurt. Finally, dog owners must be happy to look after their dog when it is sick or old.

Doctor: In that case, you may need a chest X-ray.

### 80. Why Should We Have Friends? 为什么我们需要有朋友？

We are social beings. This means we cannot live alone. We need friends to help us through hard times. When we feel sad, our friends will comfort and encourage us. When we run into troubles, they will lend us a helping hand. However, we must be careful when we choose friends. Good friends put us on the right track, while bad ones may lead us into wrongdoing. It is not too much to say that a happy life is determined by the friends we make.
